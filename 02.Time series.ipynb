    "Autoregression models, often denoted as AR models, are a fundamental component of time series analysis and forecasting. These models are used\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how autoregression models are employed in time series analysis and forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling Dependence:\n",
    "AR models assume that the current value of a time series is a linear combination of its past values, typically with a time lag. In other words,\n",
    "the current value depends on its previous values. This models the inherent memory or persistence in time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order (p):\n",
    "AR models are denoted as AR(p), where \"p\" represents the order of the model, indicating the number of lagged values considered for prediction. \n",
    "An AR(1) model uses the most recent past value, while an AR(2) model considers the past two values, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Estimation:\n",
    "To use AR models, the model parameters need to be estimated. This is typically done using methods like the method of moments, maximum likelihood\n",
    "estimation, or least squares estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection:\n",
    "The choice of the order \"p\" is a crucial aspect of using AR models. It can be determined through techniques like examining autocorrelation and \n",
    "partial autocorrelation plots. These plots help identify the number of lags that significantly affect the current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting:\n",
    "AR models are used for short-term and long-term forecasting. By plugging in lagged values, you can predict future values of the time series. The\n",
    "forecast horizon is determined by the number of steps ahead you want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Diagnostics:\n",
    "Once an AR model is fitted, diagnostics are performed to assess its adequacy. This includes checking the residuals for stationarity and independence. \n",
    "If the residuals are not white noise, it may indicate the model needs refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Extensions:\n",
    "AR models can be extended to incorporate additional components like moving averages (ARMA models), differencing for non-stationarity (ARIMA models),\n",
    "and seasonal effects (SARIMA models) to handle more complex time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",

    "the present. This is valuable for understanding the underlying dynamics of the time series.\n",
    "\n",
